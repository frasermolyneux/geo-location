    <p>
        Understandably you may wish for your data to be removed from the GeoLocation service, this can be easily done.
        <br/><br/>
        The data we hold is transitory (meaning not permanent). As such data can be deleted from the service but it will be re-added if you visit the homepage of this website or
        someone else performs a lookup using your IP Address or a domain that resolves to it. This is why anybody can submit a request to remove data.
        <br/><br/>
        Submitting the below form will remove the geo-location data associated with the address from this service. It will not remove it from the downstream MaxMind service.
    </p>
